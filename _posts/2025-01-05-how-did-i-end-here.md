title:  "how did i end up here"
---

this blog is not just another project. it is the result of learning years, moments of reflection and browsing other people's blogs. the decision to finally take a step forward has been on my mind for a long time. i want to take this first post to share how i got here, why i decided to start this space and what motivates me to keep going.

## begining the journey

looking back i realize that my profesionar path has not been a straight line (specially this last year) but a road full of curves, changes and discoveries. over the years, i have had the opportunity to work on projects that have challenged med, surround myself with peoople who has inspired me, and larn lessons that have not only shaped my careers but also the way i see the world. the most meaningful experiences are those that push you to your limits and out of your confort zone, even if at the time it does not always seem that way.

since i was a child, a constant in my life has been curiosity (from touching a heater i was told not to touch, to trying new frameworks or programming languages). i love researching, digging deep into the topics that interes me and finding new ways to approach challenges. until now, all that stayed with me, in my personal notes or in isolated conversations. 

## why starting this blog

there are mainly two reasons, it does not matter in which order do you read them. 

on one hand, this last year i have been doing quite a few job interviews and i have always been thinking that improving my online presence and my personal brand, would help a lot to improve the first impression in all aspects of employment.

on the other hand, this is space to share all those things i use, have learned over the years and reflect on the problems i am encountering in my day to day life. 

hopefully this is not just a vault for me and this content informs and/or inspires you to think in a different way. 

## the courage to begin and my motivation

as with any new project, starting this blog came with challenges. the pressure of wanting to get it right can sometimes be overwhelming, but i have learned that it is not about being perfect is about bein authentic. the real value is in taking the first step, even when you do not have all the answers. writing here is an exercise in vulnerability, in sharing not only successes, but also the learnings that come from mistakes and doubts. 

what really motivates me to keep writing is the idea that, at some point, what i share here might make a difference (small indea that awakens your curiosity, a tip to solve a problem...). beside this blog helps whoever readsit, it forces me to stop, reflect on what i know and find ways to convey in a clear and practical way. it is a constant reminder that learning never ends and that sharing it can be a transformative experience. 

## thank you for reading

finally, i want to thank you for taking the time to read these words. stating something new is always a little vertigo-inducing, but knowing that there are people willing to join me on this journey makes it all the more meaningful. 

i hope this space will be as enriching for you as it is already being for me.
